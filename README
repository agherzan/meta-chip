Please see the corresponding sections below for details.


Dependencies
============

This layer depends on:

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/bitbake

Contributing
============

Mailing list
The main communication tool we use is a mailing list:
* <yocto@yoctoproject.org>
* <https://lists.yoctoproject.org/listinfo/yocto>
Feel free to ask any kind of questions but always prepend your email subject
with "[meta-chip]". This is because we use the 'yocto' mailing list and
not a particular 'meta-chip' mailing list.

Patches and pull requests
All the contributions should be compliant with the openembedded patch
guidelines: <http://www.openembedded.org/wiki/Commit_Patch_Message_Guidelines>
To contribute to this project you should send pull requests to the github
repository (<https://github.com/agherzan/meta-chip>). **Additionally** you can
send the patches for review to the above specified mailing list so that
more people can see and review your contributions..
When creating patches for the mailing list, please use something like:

	git format-patch -s --subject-prefix='meta-chip][PATCH' origin

When sending patches to the mailing list, please use something like:

	git send-email --to yocto@yoctoproject.org <generated patch>

Github issues
In order to manage and trace the meta-chip issues, we use github issues:

I. Building the meta-chip BSP layer
========================================

To build a machine supported by this BSP layer follow the next steps:

1. source poky/oe-init-build-env chip-build
2. Add needed layer to bblayers.conf:
    - meta-chip
3  Set MACHINE to "chip" in local.conf
4. bitbake chip-hwup-image

II. Flashing a C.H.I.P. board
========================================

As part of the build including this BSP layer, a U-Boot script and a
shell script are created to assist in flashing your images to the CHIP
board. Note that this script assumes a maximum size for your UBI
image of 167772160 (0x0A000000) bytes. If your UBI image exceeds
that, then you will need to adapt this to your environment.

To successfully run this script you will first need to set your board
into FEL mode. Insert a wire into the U14 header between pin 7 (FEL)
and GND. Then connect the board with a USB cable to your host. More
details here:
    https://docs.getchip.com/chip.html#flash-chip-with-an-os

You need to specify the base filename of your UBI image using the
UBI_IMAGE shell variable before invoking the generated script as
follows:

# UBI_IMAGE=chip-hwup-image-chip.ubi \
        ./tmp/deploy/images/chip/flash_CHIP_board.sh

This script will take some time to execute. The output of this script
as run on your host machine should look similar to the following:

    # UBI_IMAGE=chip-hwup-image-chip.ubi ./tmp/deploy/images/chip/flash_CHIP_board.sh

    100% [================================================] 71303 kB,  531.1 kB/s

If you have a serial console connected to your board, you will see
progress and a message on the console indicating when flashing is
complete:

    ===========================================================
    Flashing Complete. Please power down and disable FEL mode.
    ===========================================================

Additionally, once the image is properly flashed, the status LED on
the CHIP board will flash on and off every 2 seconds. This indicates
that it is safe to power down your board and disable FEL mode.

WARNING: This will erase the entire contents of your CHIP board.

NOTE: This setup is still compatible with the CHIP flashing utility
available at http://flash.getchip.com if you choose to reinstall the
stock images.
